    <h3>what is css?</h4>
       <ol type="1">
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
          <li>CSS describes how HTML. elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media</li><br>
          <li>
             <span class="line"> Css is not neccesary</span>
              <span class="bg">CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once 
          </li><br>
          <li class="ul">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
        </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elementsl</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS . is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="bg"> in this <br> tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonsrate.and easier <br> for you to try it yourself.</li>  
    </ul>
   <p><p1>When comparing CSS class vs ID. the difference is that CSS class applies a style to one unique element.ID is also <br> special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. </p1> <br><br>
   <p2>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on web page.Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the  br
    element.</p2> <br><br>
   <p3>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements in which a style should be applied.</p3><br><br>
